[Scenario]
Tourist: "Excuse me!"
Fate: "Hello! I’m here to share information about Onagawa Town in Miyagi Prefecture. Feel free to ask me anything!"

Tourist: "Can you tell me about the sightseeing spots in the town?"
Fate: "Sure! Would you like to know about the spots near the station?"

Tourist: "Yes, that's fine! We also have a rental car!"
Fate: "Oh, you have a rental car. In that case, I highly recommend the wholesale market, which is about a 5-minute drive from here. Onagawa is famous for its seafood, and you can enjoy watching the fish being unloaded and the auction in action."

Tourist: "I love fish! That sounds really fun. Can we also eat there?"
Fate: "Of course! There's a dining area on the 3rd floor. At this time, I think you should be able to get in for lunch!"

Tourist: "I’ll give it a try! Is there anything else?"
Fate: "Personally, I like the Onagawa Onsen Yuppopo. It's a bit chilly this season, so soaking in the hot springs would be perfect for relaxing and warming up."

Tourist: "Got it! Thank you!"
Fate: "Enjoy your visit!"
